					<p>
						Jackson Wang was born on March 28, 1994, in Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong.
						The son of a Chinese Olympic fencer and a former acrobatic gymnast, 
						he grew up in Sha Tin. At the age of ten, he began practicing fencing 
						under his father’s guidance, standing out as part of Hong Kong’s national 
						youth team and winning the Asian Junior Championship in 2011.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						In 2010, he was discovered by a recruiter from <b><i>JYP Entertainment</i></b> while 
						playing basketball, and after passing his audition, he turned down a 
						scholarship to Stanford to pursue a career in K-pop. 
					</p>

					<p>
						He debuted in <b>2014</b> as a member of the group <b>GOT7</b> with the single 
						<i>Girls Girls Girls</i>. During his time with the group, he showcased 
						his talent as both a singer and songwriter.
					</p>

					<p>
						In <b>2017</b>, he began his solo career with the release of his <b>first single</b>
						<i>Papillon</i>, which reached number 1 on Billboard’s China V chart. He
						founded his own management team, <b><i>Team Wang</i></b>.
					</p>

					<p>
						In <b>2019</b>, Jackson Wang took one of the most important steps of his career
						with the release of his <b>first solo studio album</b>, <i>Mirrors</i>. That same year,
						Jackson also focused on strengthening his brand, Team Wang, which
						began positioning itself not only as a music label but also as a creative
						company linked to fashion, design, and audiovisual production.
					</p>

			<div class="biography-content2">
				<p>
						In <b>2020</b>, Jackson gained international recognition with the single <i>100
						Ways</i>, an English-language song that blended pop with oriental sounds,
						becoming his <b>major global hit</b>. Its music video, featuring a cinematic
						aesthetic inspired by Chinese mythology, quickly surpassed <b>100 million
						views</b>.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Later, he released <i>Pretty Please</i> (in collaboration with Swedish
						production duo Galantis), whose video was directed by Jackson himself
						and told a romantic story in the style of classic Hong Kong cinema. Both
						songs solidified his image as an <b>independent international artist</b>, capable
						of bridging Eastern and Western cultures through music and visual art. 
					</p>

					<p>
						The single <i>Jackson Wang</i>, released on <b>January 11, 2022</b>, marked a major
						turning point in his career. It was <b>his most personal work</b>, telling his story
						from fencer to global artist. Through honest lyrics, he redefined himself
						beyond the K-pop label, embracing his Chinese roots and showing his
						mission to connect cultures through music, solidifying his identity as an
						independent artist.
					</p>

					<p>
						On <b>September 9, 2022</b>, he released his album <i>Magic Man</i> deepened that
						transformation with a darker, more experimental sound and striking
						visuals. Featuring Blow and Cruel, it earned critical acclaim and debuted
						at <b>#15 on the Billboard 200</b>, becoming his most successful project and
						confirming him as a global artist and creative visionary.
					</p>

					<p>
						Today, Jackson works as a <b>solo artist</b> and participates in fashion activities
						through Team Wang, maintaining an international presence. His artistic
						focus has shifted toward a more <b>personal and introspective style</b>,
						reflected in his latest album, <i>Magic Man 2</i>.

							The album Magic Man 2 is a pivotal milestone for Jackson Wang 
							because it represents his most honest and introspective work to 
							date, written and produced largely on his own terms.
							The album is structured into four emotional chapters — “Manic Highs”,
							“Losing Control”, “Realizations” and “Acceptance” — mapping his journey 
							from chaos and fame-pressure to self-understanding and healing. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Commercially, it also sets new records: it debuted at #13 on the 
							Billboard 200, the highest chart position ever achieved by a Chinese 
							solo artist, underscoring his global impact. 
							Beyond the music, Magic Man 2 solidifies Jackson’s identity not just 
							as performer but as creative auteur—melding his roles as musician, 
							producer and fashion-brand founder under his label.
